        <p>Given the portfolio you selected earlier, we will generate a number of different possibilities for its performance based on its historical statistical properties.</p>
        <p>The calculated performance on your portfolio will be matched against the expenses and information provided earlier. The goal of this calculation is to determine if you have sufficient savings (or low enough expenses) that your retirement savings will generally last through your retirement.</p>
