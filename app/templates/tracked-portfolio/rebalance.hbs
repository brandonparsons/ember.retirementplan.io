    <p><h5>Investment Amount</h5></p>
    <p>Enter the amount of liquid assets you intend to invest in ETFs. This should be close to the amount you entered as "Assets" in the retirement simulation.  We use this information to provide guidance on the number of ETF units to purchase in order to hit your target allocation.</p>

      <p>Hopefully we have done the heavy lifting for you - if you purchase the amount of shares shown above, you should spend the amount you intended to invest, and will end up with the correct asset allocation.  However, we can't assume you ended up with this exact number (or decided to invest a different amount)!  Therefore we need you to come back and let us know what you ended up with after you've invested your funds.  We can't track your portfolio (and notify you when you are out of balance) until you come back and fill us in on your holdings!</p>

      <p>If you did not buy/sell the amounts shown above, edit the values in the table prior to submission.</p>

      <p>Once you have purchased these ETFs, click the button below. Your holdings will not be updated until you confirm this transaction. After confirmation, we will start tracking these securities, and alert you when your portfolio gets out of balance.</p>

      <h5>How do I purchase ETF's?</h5>

      <p class='text-muted'>
        ETF's are traded on the open market, just like regular stocks.  Therefore you have a number of purchase options to consider.  Most banks have discount brokerages (e.g. TD Waterhouse) which will allow you to purchase ETF's at the branch over the internet.  There are also a number of discount brokerages that Canadians can use for stocks/ETF's/options.  Examples would be <a href="http://www.questrade.com/" title="Questrade" target="_blank">Questrade</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbrokers.com/" title="Virtual Brokers" target="_blank">Virtual Brokers</a>, or <a href="https://us.etrade.com/home" title="ETrade" target="_blank">ETrade</a>.
